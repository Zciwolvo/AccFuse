        <p>
          We are a website that utilizes PSD2 to retrieve your data from your
          bank account. Please keep in mind that we only access your account
          information; we cannot create any payment intents or initiate any
          transactions with your account. Our primary purpose is to perform
          merged analytics for all your financial data. By default, we save the
          current state of your connected accounts, but you have the option to
          remove this data from our database. Remember, we only manage your
          dataâ€”you remain the owner.

        <p>
          To get started with our service, you'll first need to create an
          account on our website. This account will serve as the foundation for
          all your banking information and analytics.
        </p>

        <div class="image-placeholder">Image Placeholder</div>

        <p>
          Next, you'll choose one of the banks we work with that you have an
          account in. Thanks to the PSD2 directive, we can securely retrieve all
          relevant information about your accounts, including transaction
          history, balance details, and your personal information such as your
          name and surname.
        </p>

        <!-- PSD2 Explanation -->
        <h3 class="section-subtitle">What is PSD2?</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          PSD2, or the Payment Services Directive 2, is a European regulation
          designed to make payments more secure, boost innovation, and help
          banking services adapt to new technologies. It mandates that banks
          open their payment services and customer data to third-party providers
          (like us) in a secure and standardized way. This allows us to access
          your financial data safely and offer services such as consolidated
          analytics across multiple bank accounts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once we've obtained your account information, our backend processes
          and analyzes the data. This analyzed data is then presented to you on
          your personalized dashboard, offering a comprehensive overview of your
          financial status across all connected accounts.
